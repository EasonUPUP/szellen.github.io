<p> Aloha, I am a student at University of Virginia, majoring in Computer Science and Psychology in College of Arts and Sciences. 
    I am currently a third year undergrad, and plan to continue doing a master degree here at UVa. </p>


 <p>I am a software developer, and my interests include HCI, system engineering, cognitive psychology and psychological well-being. 
     I worked as a SQA intern at Brion-ASML in summer, 2019; 
     currently I am working in ROCA- a real time course observation tool at UVa Curry education school. 
     I am also doing research on tactile change blindness with Prof Riggs, and analysing sensor datas with Prof Doryab. 
     You can check out my works <a href="{{ "/work" | relative_url }}">here</a>.</p>

<p>Dancing is a big part of my life - Iâ€™ve been dancing Ballet since I was 6, and now I am exploring traditional chinese dance, modern dance, and ballroom dance. 
    I also love baking, photography, and dreaming. I am an amateur video editor, a language tutor, a certified mental health first aider, and an aspired world traveller.
